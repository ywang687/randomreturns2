Like the original Randomness of Returns app, this is meant to demonstrate how factors beyond your control can have a significant effect (maybe as significant as the efficacy of your actual strategy) on your trading. The difference is, in this app, I wanted to focus on the people who are not daytraders scalping for that microprofit many times a day (something I realize is not everyone's cup of tea). This is for the people with portfolios, who have a slightly different approach when it comes to evaluating risk. Namely, if you're an investor, you're much more likely to look at % gains and losses, and % of capital at risk in any single trade, as opposed to dollar values. As a non-daytrader, you might think that randomness will have a lower impact on your activity. Play around with the app, and see if your current strategy produces the equity curves you desire. For example, I learned that even if your profits are twice as big as your losses (10% vs 5%), you will still end up losing money on most equity curves if your winrate is only 30%.
